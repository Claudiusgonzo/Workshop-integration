# Trainer information

Thank you for taking time to support the second whiteboard design sessions as a trainer!

## Role of the trainer

Refer to the whiteboard-session-1 for what an amazing trainer looks like (go look in the mirror :))

## Whiteboard design session flow

From an abstract perspective, integration is about discovering a journey. Organizations/teams usually:

* Have an OK idea about the current state, with best case being an asset register of sorts, and worse case being concepts inside someone's  head
* Have a rough idea about the end state, usually an idea inside someone's head
* No idea about the journey towards that

The idea of this workshop is to help people discover what that journey is, or give them the confidence that we can help them discover that.

You'll find one of 2 things occurs:

1. People have lots of small integration points to document and implement, or;
2. They have a biztalk implementation which has one giant integration scenario which requires 60 steps

Point-1 is straight-forward enough, point-2 is a bit more tricky and this is where the documentation stage comes in handy. A swimlane diagram is a good idea here.

The second whiteboard design session uses the following flow:

**Step 1: Design your integration asset register (15 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Analyze the groups needs and design an asset register.

- Think about the current points of integration the group has - be proactive and drive discussion

- Current infrastructure configurations - on-premise connectivity, cloud, saas etc.

- Potential issues, objectives and blockers - what's their current problems?

**Step 2: Design a logic construct from the asset register (60 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the room in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

- Design and diagram your solution.

- Prepare to present your solution.

**Step 3: Design the technical solution (30 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Present solution to the group:

- Present solution

- Receive feedback

**Wrap-up (15 minutes)**

- Review preferred solution

# Integration workshop whiteboard design session trainer guide

## Step 1: Design the asset register

- Sith with group and drive the discussion

- We want stuff written down ASAP, this should be straight-forward as people know their own stuff

- Participants can use their documentation tool of choice - if they have one big biztalk implementation they want to solve that's perfectly fine, and might use a swimlane diagram or something.

- Aim to have at least 5 seperate integration definitions, or a single integration workflow of decent size

## Step 2: Design the logical architecture

- Again, drive the discussion

- Get something quickly up on a whiteboard, so it can be refined

- Ask the table about patterns and how they apply here, write them down next to the diagram

## Step 3: Design the technical solution

- Again, drive discussion here

- Ask the group about the previous whiteboard section, technologies they used or could have used here

- Ask how patterns apply, and which tools could be used

- Ask about on-prem, cloud and saas traffic flows

## Wrap-up

- Have the table participants reconvene with the larger session group to hear the facilitator/SME share the following preferred solution.
