# Trainer information

Thank you for taking time to support the second whiteboard design sessions as a trainer!

## Role of the trainer

Refer to the whiteboard-session-1 for what an amazing trainer looks like (go look in the mirror :))

## Whiteboard design session flow

The second whiteboard design session uses the following flow:

**Step 1: Design your integration asset register (15 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Analyze the groups needs and design an asset register.

- Think about the current points of integration the group has - be proactive and drive discussion

- Current infrastructure configurations - on-premise connectivity, cloud, saas etc.

- Potential issues, objectives and blockers - what's their current problems?

**Step 2: Design a logic construct from the asset register (60 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the room in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

- Design and diagram your solution.

- Prepare to present your solution.

**Step 3: Design the technical solution (30 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Present solution to the group:

- Present solution

- Receive feedback

**Wrap-up (15 minutes)**

# Integration workshop whiteboard design session trainer guide

## Step 1: Design the asset register

- Sith with group and drive the discussion

- We want stuff written down ASAP, this should be straight-forward as people know their own stuff

- Participants can use their documentation tool of choice - if they have one big biztalk implementation they want to solve that's perfectly fine, and might use a swimlane diagram or something.

- Aim to have at least 5 seperate integration definitions, or a single integration workflow of decent size

## Step 2: Design the logical architecture

- Again, drive the discussion

- Get something quickly up on a whiteboard, so it can be refined

- Ask the table about patterns and how they apply here, write them down next to the diagram

## Step 3: Design the technical solution

- Again, drive discussion here

- Ask the group about the previous whiteboard section, technologies they used or could have used here

- Ask how patterns apply, and which tools could be used

- Ask about on-prem, cloud and saas traffic flows

## Wrap-up

- Have the table participants reconvene with the larger session group to hear the facilitator/SME share the following preferred solution.
