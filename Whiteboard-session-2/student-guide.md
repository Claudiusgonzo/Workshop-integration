# Integration workshop whiteboard design session student guide

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this second whiteboard design session, you will work with in a group with an SME to programmatically design a technical solution to your current integration problems. It's important to follow the prescribed process oppose to jumping into the technical solution straight-away.  The goal is to critically think of requirements, patterns and documentation of an integration solution, oppose to what technologies to use.

By the end of this whiteboard design session, you will have a better understanding of how your 'end-state' scenario can be achieved by way of patterns, problems resolved while documenting the process.

## Step 1: Design your integration asset register

**Outcome**

Analyze your own needs.

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions: The group designs an integration asset register with help from the SME. This is in any format you desire, such as the template provided, or a swimlane diagram, or something else entirely.

Some points to think about

* How can each integration point be split up into modular, discreet components?
* Does your table use biztalk? How is this documented?
* What is on-premise, what's in the cloud, what SaaS products are used?
* Again, split each point into discreet single integration points

## Step 2: Design a logic construct from your asset register

**Outcome**

Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

Timeframe: 60 minutes

**Design**

Directions: With all participants at your table and the SME, design the logical architecture based on the asset register.

Use a whiteboard, visio, flipchart, any tool of your choice to do this. Keep in mind you will constantly be changing things.

## Step 3: Design the technical solution

**Outcome**

Present a solution to the audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

Timeframe: 30 minutes

**Presentation**

Directions:

Each table presents in the following format: 

1. The group presents their asset register/documentation.

2. The group then presents their logical diagram.

3. The group then presents their technical solution.

4. The next group presents their solution as per steps 1-3.

## Wrap-up

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions: Tables reconvene with the larger group to hear the facilitator/SME share the preferred solution for the case study.
